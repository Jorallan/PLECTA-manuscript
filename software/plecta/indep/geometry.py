"""Local geometry of a stub, and the cost of joining two stubs.

A *stub* is one end of an arm.  Everything the linker needs to know about it is
summarised by a frame: where the tip is, which way the arm leaves the tip, and
how fast it is turning there.

The frame is fitted in arclength, with the tip at ``s = 0`` and ``s`` growing
*into* the arm, then re-expressed outward, because every question the linker
asks ("does this arm continue into that one?") is about the outward direction.

    a straight horizontal one.

    Degree is chosen by how much support there is: a quadratic needs enough of
    the arm to be worth its extra variance, otherwise the fit is a straight line
    and the curvature is reported as 0.  ``min_quadratic`` is compared against
    the **arclength** spanned, not the pixel count -- a diagonal run covers

    Two independent pieces of evidence, because each fails on its own:

    * ``theta`` -- the angle between a's outward tangent and b's *reversed*
      tangent. Robust when the tips are close (a crossing), because it never
      touches the tip-to-tip chord, which is badly quantised at short range.
      Blind to lateral offset: two parallel arms that never meet score 0.
    * ``phi_a + phi_b`` -- how far each tangent has to turn onto the chord that
      actually connects the tips. Sees lateral offset, and is what matters
      across a gap, but is meaningless when the tips are a couple of pixels
      apart. ``chord_floor`` fades it out at short range instead of letting
      quantisation noise dominate.

    ``w_kappa`` adds curvature continuity.  Signed curvature flips sign when a
    curve is traversed backwards, and the two frames look outward from opposite
    ends of the join, so a smooth continuation wants ``kappa_a + kappa_b`` near
    zero.  It is off by default: these filaments turn slowly enough that the
    second derivative is mostly fit noise unless the support is long.
