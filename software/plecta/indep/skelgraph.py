"""Turn a thin binary filament mask into a graph of arms and crossings.

The mask is a 1-px axis mask, so its skeleton is essentially the mask itself.
Removing the pixels where three or more skeleton pixels meet cuts the mask into
*arms*: maximal pieces that contain no ambiguity at all.  Everything the method
has to decide is then expressed on this graph:

* at a **node** (a crossing) -- which arm continues into which,
* between two **free stub ends** -- whether a mask gap should be bridged.

Nothing here looks at ground truth.

Two deliberate choices that make the output line up with the project scorer's
atomic units (``eval/core/common_metric.common_fragments``):

* the same 3-px dead-end spur rule is applied before splitting, so my arms and
  the scorer's fragments are the same pieces of skeleton;
* junction *clusters* are merged when they are joined by a stub shorter than
  ``bridge_px`` (<= 5).  The scorer discards fragments below 6 px, so no scored
  fragment is ever swallowed into a node by this merge.
